  Mycorrhizal Growth
}
\description{
  The growth of mycorrhiza is controlled by the limitation in C or N.

  \eqn{\min \{a C, b N \}}

  Where a is the growth rate for fungi dependent on C, and b is the growth rate of fungi dependent on N.

  Linear functions as in Meyer 2010 and Franklin 2014.

  The balances of the element that wasn't limited is then updated based on the one that was

  Usage of non-limited element = \eqn{\text{Non-limited element} * (\text{Limited element} / \text{Non-limited element})}

}

\usage{
myco_growth(C_fungal,
            N_fungal,
            a,
            b)
}

\arguments{
  \item{C_fungal}{
    Carbon in the fungal biomass
  }
  \item{N_fungal}{
    Nitrogen in the fungal biomass
  }
  \item{a}{
    Factor for the C decomposition
  }
  \item{b}{
    Factor for the N decomposition
  }
}

\value{
  \item{growth}{Mycorrhizal growth in terms of kg C.}
  \item{carbon_used}{Cabon used for growth in terms of kg C.}
  \item{nitrogen_used}{Nitrogen used for growth in terms of kg C eq.}
